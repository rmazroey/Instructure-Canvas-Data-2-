# Instructure-Canvas-Data-2-
This project provides a Django management command to import TSV (tab-separated values) files from CanvasData 2 CLI downloads into a PostgreSQL database. The script reads CSV files generated by CanvasData, processes them, and upserts the data into the appropriate PostgreSQL tables.
